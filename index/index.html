                    My name is Yifan Wu and the program I am studying
                    are DECO7180, DECO7230, CSSE7030 and ENGG7811.
                    My bachelor’s degree was environmental design,
                    so as a designer, I am good at using some design
                    software such as photoshop, Illustrator, 3DsMAX
                    and Sketchup. Therefore, I did a lot of graphic
                    design related work in the project.
                    <br><br>In terms of
                    design, Bauhaus gave me enlightenment, but now
                    I have become obsessed with minimalism because
                    the graphics in minimalism design do not have a
                    trace of redundancy. This kind of simple philosophy
                    is what I am pursuing. This is reflected in the
                    part of design in the project.

                            Firstly, about the concept of the project, I had different ideas at first, but then I
                            reached
                            an agreement with everyone. About the music page, I set up a small game that interacts with
                            the
                            user. I use the crossbar to simulate the starting position of the playing, let the user drag
                            the
                            syllable to compose the song. When the song is completed, users can drag the crossbar to the
                            position they want to play, then the song starts playing. However, this plan was eventually
                            given up because it was too difficult to implement.
                        </p>
                        <div class="assessment-text-images">
                            <img src="../images/framework.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Based on the contents of the database, we determined that the target audience is the one who
                            is
                            interested in WW1 and music during this period. After that, we set the age period. The range
                            of
                            users I propose is old because the age of their lives is closer to the history of World War
                            I.
                            But then we thought that more young people should be remembered in this history and feel the
                            meaning of WW1, so after discussion, we set the target audience to young people.
                            About the storyboard, I draw another version that is different from the version which was
                            exhibited. I set it as four parts: earphone mode, share with a friend, share with a group of
                            friends and use without a voice. However, since the classification of this version is too
                            cluttered and does not reflect the adaptability of multiple devices on the web, we dropped
                            it in
                            this period.
                        </p>
                        <div class="assessment-text-images">

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, in the part of the interaction, I designed a version of the nostalgic photo frame
                            and picture prompt text when the mouse clicked on the note, however, since the image is
                            directly called from the database, the amount of the image is very large. In this case, it
                            is impractical to add a title to each image, so the final version of these pictures have no
                            comments.
                        </p>
                        <div class="assessment-text-images">
                            <br>
                            <img src="../images/album.JPG" alt="album">

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Thirdly, about the general style of the style, I use the minimalism. We vote for the style
                            by
                            the corresponding image shown by me. In addition to the minimizes style, the options are Pop
                            style, Chinese traditional style. glitch style, vaporware style, pixel style, extremely
                            style,
                            cubist style, and super realistic style. We set the rule that "the style with four votes is
                            the
                            best option", and finally, only minimalism got four votes, so we choose it.

                            Fourthly, about the key interaction in music page, I proposed the acceleration function. But
                            compared to the acceleration function, the deceleration function is not very much needed, so
                            we
                            basically did not add this function because of the basic minimalist design style and reduced
                            user considerations.

                            Lastly, about the presentation in part A, I help make the PPT. I am responsible for a part
                            of
                            the picture selection work. In order to match the theme, all the images are selected from
                            the
                            database, including the start image of each part and the background image of the ww1 page.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>


                <div class="assessment-reflection-journal" id="content-partA-journal">
                    In the journal of week6, I know seven principles of the worldcafe. The “Encourage Everyone's
                    Contribution” and “Listen Together for Patterns & Insights” principles are guideline of our project.
                </div>

                <div class="assessment-reflection-reflection" id="content-partA-reflection">
                    I think that although the design of this stage is more conceptual, since this is part A, I think
                    this
                    part of the project was a success, including the visual part, the interactive part, and the code
                    framework part.
                    <br><br>
                    However, there are still areas for improvement in this project, such as the integration of the
                    ideas of
                    the two designers. Often there are differences between the ideas of the two designers but finding a
                    balance between the two designs is a very difficult task, often only one of them can be completely
                    abandoned and the other is chosen. In addition, some of my ideas are too idealistic, and some of the
                    designer's ideas are too idealistic, the coder cannot realize them due to technical constraints. So,
                    the
                    designer's idea needs to be more operational. For example, the cubist style previously conceived,
                    which
                    means all the images imported into the database should be transformed into stereoscopic.

                            Firstly, I drew the paper prototype to make it easier for teammates to modify. All color
                            schemes are roughly the same as the web pages to be implemented. I use the sketchbook on
                            the iPad. This software can add and hide layers, so we don't have to worry about the loss
                            of previous ideas. All we need to do is write down each person's opinion in purple (distinct
                            from the color of the page) and then hide the layer to get the final plan. Although some
                            adjustments were made in the end, the final web page of this step was made according to
                            this paper prototype generally.
                        </p>
                        <div class="assessment-text-images pictures-paragraph">
                            <br>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, I optimized the background set by coder Zichong Chen because the color purity he
                            designed was too high. In addition, in order to make the webpage more chronological, I
                            combined
                            the background texture designed by the team member in the individual project, set the
                            background
                            color transparency to 60% and set it to the upper layer of the layer where the texture is
                            located.
                        </p>
                        <div class="assessment-text-images pictures-paragraph">
                            <br>

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Thirdly, I set the footer to black to correspond to the header. We also set up a share link
                            between facebook and Twitter, although it is a pity that the function of this link is not
                            implemented. In this part of the design, I reached a consensus with desinger Nan Xiao.
                        </p>
                        <div class="assessment-text-images">
                            <img src="../images/partB/footer.JPG" alt="footer">
                        </div>

                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Fourthly, I optimized some of the details in the page, such as the arrows that switch
                            images. The angle of the player's reaction arrow is too prominent, so I set up a radius
                            to make it look a bit more rounded and better integrated with the other elements of the
                            page.
                        </p>
                        <div class="assessment-text-images pictures-paragraph" id="arrow">

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Fifthly, I optimized all the music scores. Due to the limitations of the page, we can only
                            put a part of the score, but the original score is a whole page, so I cut and spliced it
                            without affecting the main melody. Finally, the following effects are achieved. All scores
                            and music playback are exactly the same.
                        </p>

                <div class="assessment-reflection-journal" id="content-partB-journal">
                    During the lecture in week7, I review the roadmap and relocate the stage we are in.
                    We must constantly iterate over the idea of the roadmap to ensure the quality of each iteration.
                    In addition, we encountered a major issue about the link between pages and the skip button. We
                    planned to reduce the horizontal link arrow on the music page and keep the slide bar in the bottom.
                    However, we do not choose any plan because this interaction has no sense. Although this program is
                    not used, we have realized the meaning of useful interaction.

                        <img src="../images/journal2.png" alt="arrow_radius">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="assessment-reflection-reflection" id="content-partB-reflection">
                    I think Our cooperation in this part has made significant progress over the previous part. For
                    example, the interface between paper prototype and implement is very smooth. This is because there
                    are intuitive and uniform standards, such as the color of the corresponding part is directly marked
                    in the Paper prototype, the coder can be set directly according to the above color. This method can
                    also be used in later work.
                    <br> <br>
                    However, there are still some minor problems. Firstly, the About function in the footer seems to
                    overlap with some of the headers, you can add other elements to replace or directly delete.
                    In addition, there is no effective communication between the coder of our team, resulting in some
                    parts of the work completely coincident. Given that the quality of one of the coder-designed
                    websites is too low and there is no online editing using filezilla, there is no way to synchronize
                    the communication. We put all the coder work on the other coder, so the assignment is unreasonable,
                    even We have adjusted the number of tasks assigned when we write the report.

                        <p>
                            In this part, the role played by the designer is limited, because the initial design has
                            been completed, and only the fine-tuning of the details is left. <br><br>
                            First of all, in the photo interface, since we changed the way the image was viewed from a
                            sliding switch to a keyword search, I removed all the arrows that switch horizontally to
                            make the style uniform. <br><br>
                            Secondly, I modified the interaction process. Since the coder reaction WW1 page and the home
                            page jump method is difficult to achieve, I will merge the two pages, leaving only the home
                            button in the header. <br><br>
                            Thirdly, I modified the way the music interface chose album. Since the original range of the
                            stacked albums is too small to click, and the selection method is not intuitive, I proposed
                            the idea of spreading them out for the coder. <br><br>
                            Fourthly, because the slow play effect I'm conceiving is difficult to implement, we can only
                            remove it, leaving only the play and pause functions. <br><br>
                            Fifthly, because of the size problems in the implementation, for example, some paragraphs
                            are too long to cause the displayed notes to be abnormally small. I have modified the music
                            score again.

                        <p>
                            Sixthly, we removed the click-and-switch interaction of the about interface I designed
                            earlier, because it doesn't show everyone's data at the same time.<br><br>
                            Seventhly, in order to balance the text of the page, I reversed the text and image position
                            on the music detail page.

                        </p>

                <div class="assessment-reflection-journal" id="content-partC-journal">
                    In the journal of week11, I have reconsidered the entire design process, the remaining time to
                    complete the project and what can I do to ensure tasks will be completed on time. This gives me a
                    clear understanding of the current stage of the project, and I have come up with some ways to
                    improve efficiency, such as timely use of google drive for file transfer and google doc for
                    real-time ideas exchange.
                </div>

                <div class="assessment-reflection-reflection" id="content-partC-reflection">
                    In this project, I feel the biggest regret is that due to technical reasons, the music player
                    interface lacks fast forward and rewind functions, which makes the interactive method of the page
                    not meet the expected requirements. In addition, I was prepared to design the XY coordinates
                    combined with keyword retrieval methods originally, which is undoubtedly more efficient. However,
                    because the keywords of database music are too scattered, it is too hard to organize them, so the
                    retrieval method is still improved. Space.<br><br>
                    Overall, after many adjustments, the website has been greatly improved. After removing the
                    inefficient design scheme with the minimalism as the guideline, the webpage has become more concise
                    and practical.<br><br>
                    In terms of group work, we have completed the tasks in time according to the plan, and we can
                    communicate with each other in time to improve efficiency. Therefore, I think the project was a
                    success.

                    In our group, because everyone has an iPad, we are used to communicating through the sketchbook on
                    the iPad. Everyone's opinion is one layer. In this way, we can visually see the evolution of ideas
                    through the order in which the layers are created. After each part gets the feedback, we are used to
                    writing down your opinions and testing by hiding the previous version and drawing an improved
                    version. If the test result is improved compared to the previous version, for example, the
                    interaction of clicking the album is smoother, we keep the new one and delete the layer of the
                    previous version; if it can't be improved, then delete the modified part, turn the old version to be
                    visible.

                    <strong>Meeting expectations:</strong>
                    <br>
                    From my first journal, my original expectations are mastering the ideation process, the programming
                    process such as PHP and JS, and communication of ideas. The best thing I know about is the ideation
                    process because I have to generate a large number of ideas and implement them. In this iterative
                    process, I have a very deep understanding of the idea process and I am also skilled at communicating
                    ideas. However, since I am a designer in the project, I am still weak in the programming process.
                    Although I have learned a lot in the workshop, I have not practiced it. Therefore, it cannot be used
                    flexibly.
                    Although there were many setbacks in the process, I always insisted on expectations as I progressed
                    in the course.

                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Learning across the course:</strong>
                    <br>
                    In the contact, the most profound thing I learned is how to communicate. In worldcafe, I learned how
                    to listen to the ideas of multiple people and introduce them to the concepts I understand while
                    hosting the presentation. In addition, I understand that when the idea is stuck, the most effective
                    way to solve the problem is to communicate with others, instead of thinking about it yourself, such
                    as consulting tutor, as long as we clear the questions we need to ask in advance, usually we can get
                    very good guide.

                    <br><br>
                    In the process of completing the assessment, I understand the importance of reasonable time and
                    efficient communication, which is the key to completing the assessment in time. In addition, the
                    rational allocation of tasks is also very important. It is critical that everyone is responsible for
                    what they are good at.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Changes to improve the experience of the course:</strong>
                    <br>
                    I think that if the workshop can get more help and guidance from the instructor, my learning will be
                    more efficient. Usually I will get stuck with a problem for a long time. If the tutor can help at
                    this time, the process will speed up a lot. In addition, the work of the workshop does not have an
                    assessment mechanism, so students sometimes do not have to do it. If the assessment mechanism for
                    assignments is increased, students will improve their efficiency by creating a sense of urgency.

                    <strong>About the course itself</strong>
                    <br>
                    This course contains a lot of content, we can learn very rich content, such
                    as generating ideas, communicating with partners, arranging time, coding and designing. But my think
                    group task should be set more rigorous assessment the mechanism clearly divides the tasks that each
                    person has to accomplish, so that each team member can be urged to invest more in the part he is
                    responsible for, and the efficiency of the task and the quality of the work will become higher.
